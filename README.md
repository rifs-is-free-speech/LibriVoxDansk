# LibriVoxDansk

This is a toy dataset for Danish ASR. This dataset consists of audio recordings
from [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/) with text from [WeirdSpace Digital
Library](https://weirdspace.dk/). All sound files and text files are in the
public domain. As such there is no license with this dataset

## Intended use

This dataset consists of danish fairy tales. It is unlikely that this dataset can
be used for training. Though we consider it a good dataset for both developing
methods, but also to test ASR systems. 

## WeirdSpace Digital Library

All text material is from [WeirdSpace Digital
Library](https://weirdspace.dk/). On the site they declare the following: 

*Public domain historier som pt. er tilgængelige. Vær venligst opmærksom på, at
